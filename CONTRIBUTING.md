# Bugs / Features

If you find something wrong with Coldstorm, or think something should totally
be added to it (that will make it better),
[create an issue](https://github.com/coldstorm/coldstorm/issues/new) for it.

Here are some of the things that make a great issue:

- Clear explanation of what went wrong or what you want
- Pictures (or words) that help explain what is going on, or how to reproduce
  the issue.
- Any guidance on how you think it can be fixed or implemented

If you have a feature suggestion and are planning on doing it yourself,
create a pull request for it while you work on it.  This will allow us to
track your progress and will prevent any last-minute issues that could have
been fixed sooner.

# Pull requests

We love pull requests, it makes us a real open source project.  Here's a
quick overview of how to contribute:

1. Fork this repository on GitHub.
2. Make your changes.
3. Commit your changes with a useful commit message.
4. Push to your fork.
5. Make a pull request which explains what you actually changed.

And then all you have to do is wait for us to look at the pull request.  We
will try to get to them as soon as possible.

# General guidelines

A few guidelines to follow:

- No hard tabs, we use 4 spaces for tabbing.  It's obvious when you don't.
- No trailing whitespace, and empty shouldn't have any whitespace.
- No spaces around arguments, and braces should go on a new line.
- All lines should be hard wrapped at 80 characters or less.
- Any formatting fixes should go in a separate commit

But most importantly, unless you are planning on changing all of the code
around you to match these guidelines, stick with the guidelines of the code
that is around you.
